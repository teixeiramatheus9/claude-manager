//
// From Claude Code's own schema: 'accept' delivers them, 'hold' parks them for
// review without letting Claude act, 'refuse' opts the session out. Leaving it
// unset is NOT the same as 'accept': unset means mode parity, where a message
// auto-delivers only if the sender's permission-mode class matches the
// receiver's, and a sender that asserts no class (this app, which is not a
// Claude session and has no permission mode) is held whenever the receiving
// session bypasses permission prompts.
